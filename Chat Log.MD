Hey, I just got terraria, and I'm trying to create a character. The game gives me four options, journey, classic, mediumcore, and hardcore. Which one should I go with?

The difficulty option you choose in Terraria will affect the overall difficulty of the game.

"Journey" mode is the easiest difficulty, with increased spawning of friendly NPCs and other features to make the game more accessible for new players.
"Classic" mode is the normal difficulty, with standard game mechanics and enemies.
"Mediumcore" mode is slightly harder than classic, in this mode if you die, you will lose all of your items except for a few that are marked as "essential."
"Hardcore" mode is the most difficult, in this mode if you die, your character is deleted and you have to start over.

It depends on your personal preferences, if you're new to the game, you may want to start with "Journey" or "Classic" mode and work your way up to the harder difficulties as you become more familiar with the game.

pick one of them for me, journey or classic?

If you're new to the game, I would recommend starting with "Journey" mode. This difficulty is tailored for new players and will give you a chance to familiarize yourself with the game's mechanics without the added pressure of permadeath or losing items on death. "Journey" mode has increased spawning of friendly NPCs and other features to make the game more accessible for new players. Once you have a good understanding of the game, you can then move on to the "Classic" mode, which is the normal difficulty with standard game mechanics and enemies.

give me a cool name for my character

"Vortexblade"

what world size should i go with?

In Terraria, the world size you choose will affect the overall size of the map you'll be exploring. The three options are "Small," "Medium," and "Large."

"Small" world size is best for players who want a shorter playthrough, or those who prefer a more focused experience with fewer resources.
"Medium" world size is the default option, and it provides a good balance between exploration and resources.
"Large" world size is best for players who want a longer playthrough, or those who want a lot of resources and a lot of places to explore.

It depends on your personal preferences, if you want a shorter playthrough with fewer resources, "Small" world size would be ideal for you. If you want a longer playthrough with a lot of resources and a lot of places to explore, "Large" world size would be better.

You can always change the world size later on, so you can try different world size to see what you prefer.

pick one of them for me

If you're new to the game and don't have a preference, I would recommend starting with a "Medium" world size. It provides a good balance between exploration and resources, it gives you enough to play around with and explore without feeling overwhelmed. As you become more familiar with the game, you can experiment with different world sizes to find what you prefer.

The games give me four options, journey, classic, expert, and master. Which one should I go with?

My apologies, the information I provided earlier is incorrect. It seems like you are playing the newer version of Terraria where the difficulty options are Journey, classic, expert, and master.

"Journey" mode is the easiest difficulty, with increased spawning of friendly NPCs and other features to make the game more accessible for new players.
"Classic" mode is the normal difficulty, with standard game mechanics and enemies.
"Expert" mode is harder than Classic, with increased difficulty, more powerful enemies and new mechanics.
"Master" mode is the most difficult, featuring the highest difficulty and the most challenging enemies.

It depends on your personal preferences, if you're new to the game, you may want to start with "Journey" mode and work your way up to the harder difficulties as you become more familiar with the game. If you're looking for a bigger challenge, "Expert" or "Master" mode would be suitable for you.

should i go with random, corruption, or crimson?

In Terraria, the world type you choose will affect the biomes, enemies, and other features that you'll encounter in the game. The three options are "Random," "Corruption," and "Crimson."

"Random" world type will randomly select one of the other two types.
"Corruption" world type features the Corruption biome, which is known for its purple-colored foliage and enemies like the Eater of Worlds and the Brain of Cthulhu. The Corruption also spreads through the world, slowly corrupting the land and changing the biomes.
"Crimson" world type features the Crimson biome, which is known for its red-colored foliage and enemies like the Queen Bee and the Perforators. The Crimson also spreads through the world, slowly replacing the Corruption and changing the biomes.

Again it depends on your personal preference, if you want a surprise each time you start a new game, "Random" would be ideal for you. If you want to experience the Corruption biome and enemies, "Corruption" would be your choice. If you want to experience the Crimson biome and enemies, "Crimson" would be your choice.

pick one of them for me

If you're new to the game and don't have a preference, I would recommend starting with "Corruption" world type. It features the Corruption biome, which is known for its purple-colored foliage and enemies like the Eater of Worlds and the Brain of Cthulhu, it also adds an extra layer of challenge as the Corruption spreads through the world, slowly corrupting the land and changing the biomes. This will give you a good introduction to the game's biomes, enemies and mechanics, and allow you to get familiar with the game before trying the other world types.

give me a good seed to play on

A good seed for Terraria can vary depending on what you're looking for, but here's a seed that should give you a great starting point:

"Terraria"

This seed will generate a world with a variety of biomes and resources close to your spawn point, making it easy to get started with your adventure. Additionally, this seed is known to have a good balance of resources, enemies, and dungeons, making it a great option for players of all skill levels.

Please keep in mind that the seed is case sensitive and should be entered exactly as it's written.

Alternatively, you can also try different seeds and see what you like, it's all about experimenting and finding what works best for you.

Give me a good world name to use

How about "Elysium's Oasis"?

Elysium is the Greek word for paradise and Oasis is a place that is a haven of life in the desert. This creates an imagery of a peaceful and lush place, a perfect place to start your adventure.

You can also try to come up with a different name, one that inspires you or something that makes you excited to play. It's all about personal preference.

I just join the world, and my inventory is full of stuff, what are they?

When you start a new game in Terraria, your inventory will be pre-populated with a set of basic items that will help you get started. These items typically include:

I don't have any of those stuffs? I got different stuff in journey mode. what are those items?

I apologize for the confusion, in "Journey" mode, the starting inventory is different from the classic mode. Since "Journey" mode is tailored for new players, the starting inventory will be different to help new players to get familiar with the game.

In "Journey" mode, you will start with a set of basic items that are different from the classic mode, some of the items you may find in your inventory are:
